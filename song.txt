Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, I put my make up on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight (I love cheap thrills)
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight (I love cheap thrills)
I got all I need
But I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing
